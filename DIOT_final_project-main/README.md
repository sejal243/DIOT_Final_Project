# 🚀 CDAC ACTS, DIOT Final Project - Life Sync: Where Time Meets Intelligence  

"Life Sync is an intelligent scheduling system that seamlessly integrates with Google Calendar, real-time location tracking, weather data, and travel time estimation. By dynamically adjusting alarms based on external factors, it ensures you wake up at the perfect time, optimizing your daily routine with smart automation. No more guessing—just sync, wake, and arrive on time!"

## **Problem Statement**  
Traditional alarm clocks operate on fixed schedules and do not account for external factors like **traffic conditions** or **weather changes**. Users often have to manually adjust their alarms based on estimated travel time, which may not always be accurate. This can result in **missed appointments** or **unnecessary early departures**.  

## **Objectives of the Project**  
The **IoT Smart Alarm Clock** aims to solve these issues by integrating multiple data sources to dynamically adjust alarm times.  

### ✅ **Key Objectives:**  
- **Google Calendar Integration:** Automatically fetch upcoming events, including time and location.  
- **Real-Time Location Tracking:** Determine the user's current position using GPS or network-based location services.  
- **Weather-Based Adjustments:** Fetch weather data and modify the alarm time to compensate for delays caused by adverse conditions.  
- **Travel Time Estimation:** Use Google Maps API to calculate travel duration and adjust the alarm accordingly.  
- **User Interface:** Implement a touchscreen interface for displaying event details, current time, and alarm notifications.  
- **Data Logging:** Store event details, adjusted alarm times, and travel data in Firebase for future reference.
